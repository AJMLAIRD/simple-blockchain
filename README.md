# Simple Python Blockchain

A basic implementation of a blockchain in Python 3. This blockchain consists of blocks that store data and are linked together using cryptographic hashes.

## Features

- Creation of new blocks with data.
- Recording transactions between addresses.
- Proof-of-work mechanism for mining new blocks.
- Secure hashing using SHA-256.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-python-blockchain.git
   cd simple-python-blockchain



Run the Python script to create and test the blockchain:

python blockchain.py

Usage
You can use this code as a starting point to understand the fundamental concepts behind blockchain technology. Customize and extend it to build more complex blockchain applications.

# Instantiate the blockchain
blockchain = Blockchain()

# Create some example transactions
blockchain.new_transaction("Alice", "Bob", 2.5)
blockchain.new_transaction("Bob", "Charlie", 1.0)
blockchain.new_transaction("Charlie", "David", 0.5)

# Mine a new block
last_block = blockchain.last_block
last_proof = last_block['proof']
proof = Blockchain.proof_of_work(last_proof)
blockchain.new_transaction(sender="0", recipient="Miner", amount=1)
block = blockchain.new_block(proof)

# Print the blockchain
print("Blockchain:")
print(json.dumps(blockchain.chain, indent=2))
